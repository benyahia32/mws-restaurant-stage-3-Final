### How to use?

1. First, clone the backend from [this repo](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-3)
2. Follow these instructions:

    ###### Install project dependancies
    ```Install project dependancies
    # npm i
    ```
    ###### Install Sails.js globally
    ```Install sails global
    # npm i sails -g
    ```
    ###### Start the server
    ```Start server
    # node server
    ```
3. Then, clone this repo
4. Now, open the local server:
    1. In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

    2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
